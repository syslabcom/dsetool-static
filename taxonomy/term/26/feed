 <link>https://eguides.osha.europa.eu/dangerous-substances/glossary/risk-assessment</link>
 <description> The aim of occupational 


risk assessment is to protect workersâ€™ health and safety. 


Risk assessment includes identifying 


risks, evaluating how severe the 


risk is and deciding if there is a need to take action to reduce the 


risk.
Under health and safety laws, all employers must carry out regular 


risk assessment.
